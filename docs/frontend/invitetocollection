Invite to collection
===

It is now possible to invite any person to a collection. 

Inviting existing members
-----
If the person is a user that exists in the database an email will be sent with a link to the users pending invitations page.
 
Inviting non-existing members
-----
If the person doesn't exist in the database an email will be sent to the person asking the user to create an account. If the 
person creates an account with the invited email within 1 week the user will have a pending invitation to the collection at 
the users pending invitations page. 

Invite responses
-----
When a user accepts or rejects an invitation the user who invited the new user will get an email of which action was taken.
