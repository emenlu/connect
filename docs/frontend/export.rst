Export
======

For each collection on the profile page, there exists an option to export that collection. To do so, the user has to specify a filename and also a CSV delimiter and a taxonomy leaf delimiter.

The CSV delimiter is straight-forward and specifies what should separate the values in the CSV.

The taxonomy leaf delimiter is used to separate the leaves for the taxonomy nodes. For example, if some taxonomy node has the value ["test", "test2"], and the leaf delimiter is set to "|", the value of that cell in the CSV will be (test|test2). 

The file will, as is standard, be downloaded to the users Downloads folder.
